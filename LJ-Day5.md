<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 5</h1>
<p>Today we learned about font, color, and text. A pretty easy concept to understand. Today seemed to be a rollercoaster of learning, then confusion. But all in all it wasn't too bad. I screwed my branches up on my project something fierce, but the best thing that came out of it was my comprehension of git commands. Haha </p>
