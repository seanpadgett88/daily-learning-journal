<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 11</h1>
<p>Dropping back down the learning curve. I felt like I retained the information relatively well yesterday. But I've fallen behind to the point where I feel like I won't be able to catch up. There doesn't seem to be enough time and assistance at the right times to catch up. Hopefully there will be a day where I can just power through my projects from last week, and actually understand it.</p>
