<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 8</h1>
<p>I'd say today was probably my lowest point in awhile. I tried to keep up with the lecture. I'm having a hard time retaining this information, so I find myself having to rely on other people a lot. As much as I know people are there to help, I need to let them focus on their work and I just need to figure out how to learn. I didn't make any progress on my project for today because of an illness I had to leave early. I just couldn't focus. Tomorrow's a new day.</p>
