<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 4</h1>
<p>Today we learned about functions and their uses, manual CSS margins, padding, and how much of a pain in the ass they are. However, the best part of this day was the project. Which I never thought I would say. Haha But the way that we handled that project made the understanding and productivity flow like a motherfucker. (excuse my French). Probably my most constructive day thus far. </p>
