<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 6</h1>
<p>Today was a major roller coaster. I felt like I was totally keeping all the information in my head until the last half an hour of lecture, then I did a data dump. But I was able to figure out the Javascript side of it for a change. Kinda. But all in all this project gave me hell. I wanted to finish it but it got too late. Bleh. </p>
