<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 1</h1>
<p>Today we learned about CSS, arrays, and a little bit more about Git.  Thankfully I had some familiarity with the CSS and arrays portion of the lecture, so I wasn't too lost. I felt substantially more confident than I did in yesterdays exercises for some reason. I think it'll all start coming together sooner or later. We also built our own "about me" page. I had a fair amount of success in the HTML/CSS portion of the project. But kind of struggled with the "guessing game". Just trying to figure out the syntax of the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() was a little difficult because I haven't used it before. But I've made note of it for next time.</p>
