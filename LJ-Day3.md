<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 3</h1>
<p>Today we learned about lists in HTML, boxes in CSS, and for and while loops in JS. Again, thankfully I was familiar with the CSS and HTML portion, so I was able to understand it with ease. The loops on the other hand, have little experience with, and kind of struggled with in the project for tonight. I understand what they do, down to a "T". But have an issue actually writing them out. I hope it becomes easier with time to understand the syntax and format of Javascript.</p>
