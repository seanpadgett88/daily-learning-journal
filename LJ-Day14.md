<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 13</h1>
<p>I liked that we learned more about CSS yesterday for the lecture. But it kind of blindsided me. I thought we were going to have a day to make up our assignments we needed to fix. Ozge and I were able to get alot of the groundwork layed down for the lab but it was lacking functionality. It was a frustrating day, but I feel like my understanding is starting to grow everyday....actually growing. Haha</p>
